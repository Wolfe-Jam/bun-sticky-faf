Shipped two new FAF implementations this week:

bun-sticky-faf - Bun-native CLI
• Zero dependencies
• 328 championship-grade tests
• Pure Bun APIs, TypeScript native

bun-sticky-zig - Zig-native CLI
• 77KB single binary
• Zero runtime dependencies
• Built in Bun's own language

FAF (Foundational AI-context Format) now has 18,000+ npm downloads across the ecosystem. IANA-registered. Anthropic-approved MCP server.

The problem: AI tools lose context between sessions.
The solution: A file format that persists project DNA.

### Title: bun-sticky: FAF Scoring in Pure Bun (Zero Dependencies)

```markdown
## The Problem

Every AI coding session starts the same way: explaining your project structure, tech stack, and conventions. Again.

## The Solution

FAF (Foundational AI-context Format) - a file format that persists project context. IANA-registered as `application/vnd.faf+yaml`.

## What's New

**bun-sticky-faf** brings FAF scoring to Bun:

- Zero dependencies - pure Bun APIs only
- 328 tests - championship-grade WJTTC test suite
- <50ms cold start
- TypeScript native - no build step

```bash
bunx bun-sticky-faf score
```

**bun-sticky-zig** goes further:

- 77KB binary
- Zero runtime - no Bun, no Node, nothing
- <1ms cold start
- Built in Zig (Bun's own language)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wolfe-Jam/bun-sticky-zig/main/install.sh | bash
faf score
```

## The Ecosystem

| Package | Runtime | Downloads |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| faf-cli | Node.js | 16,600+ |
| claude-faf-mcp | MCP | 1,500+ |
| bun-sticky-faf | Bun | new |
| bun-sticky-zig | Zig | new |

18,000+ total npm downloads. Same format across all tools.

### Comment:
```
I built FAF (Foundational AI-context Format) to solve context loss in AI coding sessions. Now IANA-registered, 18k+ npm downloads, Anthropic-approved MCP server.

This week I shipped two new implementations:

1. bun-sticky-faf - Pure Bun, zero deps, 328 tests
2. bun-sticky-zig - 77KB binary, zero runtime, built in Bun's language

The Zig version is interesting - Bun itself is built on Zig, so this CLI speaks Bun's native language. Sub-millisecond cold start.
